# React SideBar Component

A sidebar component that appears on click. It could either be used as a NavigationBar or just a side component.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (delete the yarn.lock file)

```bash
npm install 
```
or 

```bash
npm install 
```
3. Run the application
4. It is ready

## Goal
It would be helpful to have this component as a package so you just import and use.
